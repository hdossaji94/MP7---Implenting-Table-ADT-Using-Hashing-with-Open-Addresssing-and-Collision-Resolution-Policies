# MP7---Implenting-Table-ADT-Using-Hashing-with-Open-Addresssing-and-Collision-Resolution-Policies

[PLEASE SEE mp7.pdf FILE FOR FULL INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION!](mp7.pdf)


The goal of this machine problem is to design and implement a table ADT using hashing with open addressing and three approaches to collision resolution policies. You will investigate the performance in equilibrium with additions and deletions. The equilibrium driver will demonstrate that very poor performance is possible when there are a large number of deletions, and that rehashing the table is required to restore the table and achieve the expected performance.

Use a modular design similar to the design for the binary search tree module from MP5. A lab7.c file is provided with two test drivers, and you will add additional drivers to test your design. You will need to develop your own test drivers. Be sure to also submit a makefile that correctly builds your program and produces an executable “lab7”.

Two additional documents should be submitted. One is a test plan that describes details of your implementation and demonstrates, with a test script, how you verified that the code works correctly. The verification should include detailed prints from your program to show that you program operates correctly and has no memory leaks. The second document describes your performance evaluation, and should describe your drivers that test performance and compare the results to the equations developed by Standish.
